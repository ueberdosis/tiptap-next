# Getting started

tiptap is framework-agnostic and works with Vue.js and React. It even works with plain JavaScript, if thatâ€™s your thing. To keep everything as small as possible, we put the code to use tiptap with those frameworks in different packages.

## 1. Install the dependencies

We assume you already have a [Vue.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/) (or [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)) project. To connect tiptap with Vue.js you are going to need an adapter. You can install tiptap for Vue.js as a dependency in your project:

```bash
# Install Vue.js adapter with npm
npm install @tiptap/vue @tiptap/vue-starter-kit

# Or: Install Vue.js adapter with Yarn
yarn add @tiptap/vue @tiptap/vue-starter-kit
```

The `@tiptap/vue-starter-kit` includes a few basics you would probably need anyway. Cool, you have got everything in place to set up tiptap! ðŸ™Œ

## 2. Create a new component

Create a new Vue component (you can call it `<Tiptap />`) and add the following content. This is the fastest way to get tiptap up and running with Vue.js. It will give you a very basic version of tiptap, without any buttons. No worries, you will be able to add more functionality soon.

:::warning Using with Nuxt.js

If you are using Nuxt.js, note that tiptap needs to run in the client, not on the server. Itâ€™s required to wrap the editor in a `<client-only>` tag.

Congrats! Youâ€™ve got it! ðŸŽ‰ Letâ€™s start to configure your editor in the next step.
